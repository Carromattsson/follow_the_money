Size limits on tracing flows

`--smallest value`

  This flag lets you give a value below which you don't care to track funds any
  further. This example demonstrates this option and lays out what it means.

  Let's first compare the last-in-first-out output files with and without the
  --smallest flag. That's `account_flows_lifo.csv` from the previous example
  with `size_flows_lifo.csv` from this example. They are the same!!! This is
  because we put our size limit at $5 and there is no point at which any one of
  the accounts is holding onto a portion of a transaction smaller than that.

  Now let's do the same for the mixing heuristic. These files are identical up
  until the third of the three transaction sequences (starting with `10000021`),
  so we'll start there. Transaction `10000021` is a `cash-in` that deposits $20
  from agent `DDD` into account `XYZ`, bringing the balance up to $20 from $0.
  After transactions `10000022` and `10000023`, there is $5 left of it. That is
  when a large deposit comes in (`10000024`), bringing the balance up to $205.
  Still not a problem! Just as in the last-in-first-out we still want account
  `XYZ` to keep track of the $5 in funds from `10000021`. However, when it comes
  time to pay transaction `10000025`, a large `bill-payment`. Our account pulls
  the same fraction of funds from both `cash-ins`, leaving only $0.61 in funds
  from `10000021`. Since we don't wish to track such small sums any further, the
  program outputs a flow that ends as "untracked" money within account `XYZ`.

  Similarly, transaction `10000027` leaves less than $5 worth of the latest
  deposit (`10000024`) in the account. So this flow also ends as "untracked"
  money within account `XYZ`.

  When it comes time for `XYZ` to fill the last transaction, a $5 payment for
  `mobile minutes`, there are no tracked funds left in the account at all. Since
  this is above the size limit, the system starts to track those funds again.
  This flow begins as "untracked" money within account `XYZ` is withdrawn.

  Hopefully, it is clear what this flag is useful for. It prevents the program
  from creating many many increasingly tiny flows, which could happen fairly
  quickly under the mixing heuristic. Money that becomes "untracked" is still
  accounted for within the output file, and if there is an occasion to re-track
  funds then the program will go for it. These partial flows are clearly marked
  using the "flow_categs" column so that they can be filtered out if desired.

  Note that it's probably best to keep the size limit above that of the smallest
  transactions in the dataset. Not that the code wouldn't run just fine -- it
  would follow those transactions themselves and stop tracking ahead of any
  subsequent transactions. But it makes the flag harder to interpret.
