# Wish list #
- take inferred transactions out of the Tracker
       - check ahead of time if it is needed
       - if yes, make the transactions & process normally
       - print these into a file
- credit lines and the issuance/cancellation of endogenous credit money
- dispensation for the creation/destruction of monetary units (ex. mining)
- decentralize time_current to accounts, not system
