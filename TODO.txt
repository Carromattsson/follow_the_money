TODO

config.json
	have the sorting column be a config value, and have the internal check
	be against that rather than the timestamp by default

follow.py
	balance can magically *appear* that is below the resolution limit, multiple times
		this leaves the internal balance above the resolution limit
		so we get an inferred *withdraw* with no corresponding inferred *deposits*

	so right now we have 'initial', 'final', and 'inferred' as txn_IDs for the 'inferred' type.
	we'd like to add also 'untracked' which can be used for non-tracked funds in prior existence,
	such as when an agent makes a topup transaction and there's no continuation. Note that
	we will end up wanting to avoid the agents anyways.
