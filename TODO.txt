	balance can magically *appear* that is below the resolution limit, multiple times
		this leaves the internal balance above the resolution limit
		so we get an inferred *withdraw* with no corresponding inferred *deposits*
	more generally, when we're given a balance we should be noting balance discrepancies
		report.txt aught to include the offending transaction, the internal balance, and the adjustment
	really, it would be good to separate out *initially/finally inferred* transactions

	so right now we have 'initial', 'final', and 'inferred' as txn_IDs for the 'inferred' type.
	we'd like to add also 'untracked' which can be used for non-tracked funds in prior existence,
	such as when an agent makes a topup transaction and there's no continuation. Note that
	we will end up wanting to avoid the agents anyways.
